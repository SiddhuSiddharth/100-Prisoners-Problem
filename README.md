The core objective of the problem is to analyze the brute force algorithm and the proposed algorithm using cycles and create an insight on how much better the algorithm truly is. The algorithm can be further extended to similar problems.

The problem is of 100 prisoners who all want to choose a slip containing the numbers allocated to them. If they all do they will be freed from prison, else will all be executed. The obtained rate of success for the prisoners is 0.31 which is the maximum possible value obtainable frmo extensive research. This is an np problem.
